File/Folder Permission in Linux -->
There are 3 types fact -----------
1. Owner Permission - u
2. Group Permission - g
3. All other user permission - o
4. Usre + Group + All Other User - ugo or a

	2. Write -> w -> 2
	3. Execute -> x -> 1	
	4. No Permission -> - -> 0

Ex- rwx
Or- 421
---------------------------

- => Regular file
d => Directory
l => Symbolic Link - It represent the softlink/hardlink
------------------------------
+ => Add Permission
- => Remove Permission
= => only set the value | replacing the permission

----------------------------------
Example-- 
mkdir dirx
ls -l

drwxrwxr-x 2 debu debu 6 Jul 22 10:19 dirx
Explain-- 
d -> Regular Directory
rwx -> Owner/User
rwx -> Group

Here 3 is the karnel version.

** What is Kernel?
==> Kernel is central component of an operating system that manages operations of computer and hardware. It basically manages operations of memory and CPU time. It is core component of an operating system. Kernel acts as a bridge between applications and data processing performed at hardware level using inter-process communication and system calls. 

Kernel loads first into memory when an operating system is loaded and remains into memory until operating system is shut down again. It is responsible for various tasks such as disk management, task management, and memory management. 

It decides which process should be allocated to processor to execute and which process should be kept in main memory to execute. It basically acts as an interface between user applications and hardware. The major aim of kernel is to manage communication between software i.e. user-level applications and hardware i.e., CPU and disk memory.
